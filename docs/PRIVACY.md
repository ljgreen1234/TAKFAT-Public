# Privacy Policy - TAKFAT-Yawn-Index

## Our Commitment to Privacy

The TAKFAT-Yawn-Index project is built on principles of data privacy, anonymity, and participant protection. This document explains how we handle data and protect your privacy.

## Data Collection Principles

### 1. Anonymity First

- **No Personal Identifiers**: We never collect names, addresses, email addresses, or other directly identifying information
- **Anonymous IDs**: Participants create their own anonymous identifiers
- **No Tracking**: We don't use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics on submitted data
- **No Device Fingerprinting**: We don't collect device-specific identifiers

### 2. Minimal Data Collection

We collect only what is necessary for the research questions:
- Yawn frequency and timing
- General context (activity type, not specific details)
- Age range (not exact age)
- General location (country/region, not city or address)
- Optional wearable metrics (HRV, steps, etc.)

### 3. Participant Control

- **You Own Your Data**: You decide what to share
- **Right to Delete**: Request removal of your data at any time
- **Right to Access**: View what data you've contributed
- **Right to Correct**: Update or fix submitted data
- **Right to Withdraw**: Stop participating without explanation

## What We Collect

### Required Data

✅ **Anonymous participant ID** (you create this)
✅ **Yawn events**: Date, time, basic context
✅ **Age range**: e.g., 18-25, 26-35 (5-10 year ranges)
✅ **General health category**: Healthy, minor conditions, chronic conditions (optional)

### Optional Data

🔹 **Wearable metrics**: HRV, steps, sleep data (anonymized)
🔹 **Geographic region**: Country or large region only
🔹 **Gender**: If relevant to analysis
🔹 **COVID history**: Long COVID status (general category only)

### What We DON'T Collect

❌ Name, address, or contact information
❌ Exact birth date
❌ Photos or videos of participants
❌ Specific location data or GPS coordinates
❌ IP addresses
❌ Device serial numbers or identifiers
❌ Social media profiles
❌ Specific medical diagnoses
❌ Insurance information
❌ Financial information

## How We Protect Your Data

### Anonymization Techniques

1. **Self-Generated IDs**: You create your own anonymous identifier
2. **Data Aggregation**: Individual data points are grouped for analysis
3. **Generalization**: Specific details are converted to categories
4. **Data Minimization**: We only request necessary information
5. **No Cross-Linking**: Data cannot be linked back to individuals

### Storage and Security

- **Public Repository**: Data is stored in a public GitHub repository
- **No Encrypted Personal Data**: Because we don't collect personal data
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked and transparent
- **Open Access**: Anyone can audit our data handling practices

### Who Can Access Data

- **Everyone**: All submitted anonymized data is public
- **Researchers**: Can analyze aggregate patterns
- **Educators**: Can use data for teaching
- **You**: Can view all data in the repository

## Data Usage

### How We Use Your Data

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify trends in yawning behavior
2. **Scientific Research**: Explore autonomic health connections
3. **Education**: Create teaching materials and examples
4. **Public Insights**: Share aggregate findings with community
5. **Methodology Testing**: Improve citizen science approaches

### How We DON'T Use Your Data

❌ Commercial purposes or selling data
❌ Individual profiling or identification
❌ Marketing or advertising
❌ Insurance or employment decisions
❌ Medical diagnosis or treatment
❌ Any attempt to de-anonymize participants

## Special Considerations

### For Children and Teens (Under 18)

- **Parental Consent Required**: Parents must approve participation
- **Extra Privacy Protections**: More careful anonymization
- **Educational Context**: Best done through school with teacher supervision
- **Age Ranges**: Use broader categories (e.g., 10-15, 16-18)
- **No Direct Submission**: Submit through parent or educator

### For Health Conditions

- **No Specific Diagnoses**: Use general categories only
- **No Medical Records**: Don't share doctor's notes or test results
- **No Medications**: Don't list specific medications
- **General Status Only**: e.g., "experiencing fatigue" not specific conditions

### For Long COVID Participants

- **Self-Reported Only**: You decide what to share
- **General Categories**: "Experiencing post-viral symptoms" vs specific symptoms
- **No Medical Details**: Keep it high-level
- **Voluntary**: Never required to disclose

## Data Retention

### How Long We Keep Data

- **Indefinitely**: Research data remains in repository
- **Version Control**: Historical data preserved for research continuity
- **Deletion Requests**: We honor removal requests promptly

### Removing Your Data

To remove your contributions:
1. Open an issue with "Data Deletion Request"
2. Provide your anonymous participant ID
3. We'll remove your data within 7 days
4. Confirm deletion via issue comment

## Sharing and Publication

### What Gets Shared

- **Aggregate Statistics**: Group averages, trends, patterns
- **Anonymized Datasets**: Full data files (already anonymous)
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs of patterns
- **Research Findings**: Scientific insights and hypotheses

### What Doesn't Get Shared

- **Individual Profiles**: Never singled out
- **Identifying Patterns**: We avoid publishing anything that could identify someone
- **Raw Wearable Data**: Only aggregated metrics

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub

- **Hosting**: Repository hosted on GitHub
- **GitHub Privacy**: Subject to GitHub's privacy policy
- **Public Repository**: All data is publicly visible
- **No Private Data**: We don't use GitHub's private features for participant data

### No Other Services

- We don't currently use other third-party services
- If we do in the future, we'll update this policy
- Any service must meet our privacy standards

## International Participants

### Global Participation
