## What You'll Do 📝

Track your yawns for one week to help explore the connection between yawning and autonomic health.

## Steps to Start

### 1. Choose Your Method ✓

Pick the tracking method that works for you:

**Option A: Simple Paper Tracking**
- Print the [simple tracking sheet](../data/templates/yawn-tracking-simple.csv)
- Keep it with you
- Make a tally mark for each yawn
- Note the time and what you're doing

**Option B: Digital Spreadsheet**
- Download [yawn-tracking-simple.csv](../data/templates/yawn-tracking-simple.csv)
- Open in Excel, Google Sheets, or similar
- Add a row for each yawn
- Save regularly

**Option C: Phone Notes**
- Use your phone's notes app
- Create a simple log format
- Type entries as you yawn
- Transfer to template later

### 2. Create Your Anonymous ID 🔐

**Important**: Never use your real name!

**Create an ID like this:**
```
YI-[year]-[initials]-[random numbers]
Example: YI-1990-JD-742
```

Or just make up a random ID:
```
YI-ABC-123-XYZ
```

Write it down somewhere safe - you'll need it for all your entries!

### 3. Start Tracking 🎯

**For each yawn, record:**

✅ **Date**: Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
✅ **Time**: When it happened (24-hour format like 14:30)
✅ **Duration**: Short, medium, or long yawn
✅ **Context**: What you were doing
✅ **Environment**: Indoor or outdoor

**Example entry:**
```
YI-1990-JD-742,2025-01-15,14:30,medium,desk-work,indoor
```

### 4. Track for 7 Days 📅

- Try to catch every yawn (or as many as you can!)
- Don't worry if you miss some
- Be consistent with your format
- Keep your tracking sheet handy

**Pro tip**: Set a reminder on your phone to review your tracking at the end of each day.

### 5. Complete Daily Summaries 📊

At the end of each day, note:

- **Total yawns** for the day
- **Sleep quality** last night (poor/fair/good/excellent)
- **How you felt** (energy level, stress level)
- **Any exercise** (minutes)

**Example:**
```
YI-1990-JD-742,2025-01-15,12 yawns,7.5 hours sleep,good quality,low stress,30 min exercise
```

## Need Help? 🆘

### Common Issues

**"I keep forgetting to track!"**
→ Set hourly phone reminders, or track at the end of each activity block

**"I'm not sure what duration to pick"**
→ Don't overthink it - make your best guess, consistency matters more

**"I missed a whole day!"**
→ That's OK! Just keep going with the days you can do

**"My yawn count seems too high/low"**
→ Everyone is different! Track your actual experience
