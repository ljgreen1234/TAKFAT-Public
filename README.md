# TAKFAT-Yawn-Index

## A Citizen-Science Experiment on Yawning and Autonomic Health

Welcome to the TAKFAT-Yawn-Index project! This is an open, community-driven research initiative exploring the fascinating connection between yawning patterns and autonomic nervous system function.

### 🎯 Project Hypothesis

**Can yawn persistence (Yawn Index) reveal patterns tied to autonomic health, including long-term COVID effects?**

Yawning is a universal behavior that may be linked to autonomic nervous system regulation. By tracking yawning patterns alongside optional physiological data (heart rate variability, gait patterns), we aim to discover whether there are meaningful correlations between yawn frequency and autonomic health markers.

### 🌟 Why This Matters

- **Accessible Science**: Everyone can participate - kids, parents, educators, and researchers
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Aggregate anonymized data to identify potential patterns
- **Long COVID Research**: Explore potential connections to post-viral autonomic dysfunction
- **Educational**: Learn about the autonomic nervous system in a fun, engaging way

### 📊 What We Track

**Core Data (Required):**
- Yawn frequency and timing
- Context (activity, time of day, environment)
- Basic demographics (age range, general health status)

**Optional Wearable Data:**
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Gait patterns and walking metrics
- Sleep quality indicators
- Other biometric data from personal devices
